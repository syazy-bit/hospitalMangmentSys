**🏥 Hospital Management System (C++)**

**📌 Overview**

The Hospital Management System is a C++ console-based project designed to simplify the process of managing patient records in hospitals.
It provides essential functionalities such as adding, viewing, updating, searching, and deleting patient details, using file handling for data storage.
This system helps maintain accurate and organized patient data efficiently while demonstrating the practical use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file operations in C++.

**🎯 Objectives**

Develop a simple and efficient hospital database management system

Store and manage patient details digitally

Implement core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities

Demonstrate file handling and object-oriented programming concepts in C++



---

**⚙ System Design / Technical Approach**

Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

Defines a Patient class with attributes like ID, Name, Age, Gender, and Disease

Implements file handling (fstream) for storing and retrieving patient records

Provides options to add, search, modify, and delete patient data



---

**💡 Features / Functionality**

➕ Add new patient record

📋 Display all patient records

🔍 Search for a specific patient by ID

✏ Update existing patient details

❌ Delete a patient record

💾 Data stored permanently using file handling



---

**🧰 Implementation Details**

Programming Language: C++

Concepts Used: Classes, Objects, File Handling

Interface Type: Console-based (menu-driven)

Error Handling: Validates inputs and file operations



---

**📊 Output / Result**

The program provides a clean, text-based interface with menu options such as:

1. Add Patient
2. View Patients
3. Search Patient
4. Edit Patient
5. Delete Patient
6. Exit

All operations are successfully handled through file storage, ensuring persistent data management.


---
**🚀 Future Enhancements**

Integration with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Database connectivity (e.g., MySQL) for real-time data handling

Multi-user access and authentication features

Cloud-based storage for scalability
